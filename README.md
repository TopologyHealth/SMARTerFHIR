# SMARTerFHIR Library

The SMARTerFHIR library is a powerful toolkit for interacting with FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) servers and implementing SMART on FHIR applications. It's based on tools and digital health standards from [SMART Health IT.](https://smarthealthit.org/) It provides a set of classes and utilities to facilitate FHIR resource handling, launch contexts, and EMR (Electronic Medical Record) integration.

## Features

- **FHIR Client**: The library includes a robust FHIR client implementation that supports communication with FHIR servers using the SMART on FHIR protocol.

- **Launch Handling**: SMARTerFHIR provides a `SmartLaunchHandler` class that simplifies the process of launching applications with different EMR systems such as Cerner, Epic, or SMART Health IT. It offers methods for handling launch requests and obtaining authorization tokens.

- **Resource Transformation**: The library includes a `Transformer` namespace that provides functions for transforming FHIR resources between the standard R4 format and the FHIR client format. This enables seamless integration with different FHIR implementations.

- **Client Abstraction**: The library provides an abstract `BaseClient` class that serves as the foundation for creating EMR-specific client implementations. It includes common functionality such as resource hydration, context creation, and resource creation.

- **Cerner and Epic Clients**: The library includes concrete client implementations for Cerner and Epic EMR systems. These clients extend the `BaseClient` class and provide specific implementation details for creating and interacting with resources in Cerner and Epic environments.

- **Client Factory**: The `ClientFactory` class simplifies the creation of EMR clients by automatically determining the EMR type based on the FHIR client configuration. It returns the appropriate client instance based on the detected EMR system.

## Installation

Using npm's git repo support: `npm install git@github.com:TopologyHealth/SMARTerFHIR.git`

Support for the npm registry will be coming soon

 <!-- npm: -->
<!--
```bash
npm install smarter-fhir
``` -->

## Usage

Here's a basic example demonstrating how to use the SMARTerFHIR library:

<!-- <iframe

  style="width:100%; height:300px;"
  frameborder="0"
></iframe> -->

<div style="overflow: hidden; margin: 15px auto;">
<iframe scrolling="no" src="https://topology.health/docs/web-launch#main" style="border: 0px none; height: 2450px; margin-top: -300px; margin-bottom: 10px; width: 926px;">
</iframe>
</div>
